# MarkovChains

**Files**

MarkovChain.java: This file contains the implementation of the Markov Chain text generator. It includes methods to train the Markov chain based on input text and generate text using the trained model.

Main.java: This file contains the main class with a main method to interact with the Markov Chain text generator. It prompts the user for an input text file, the number of words to generate, and the output file name. Then, it generates text using the Markov Chain and writes the generated text to the output file.

**Usage**

Use of the Markov Chain text generator:

Run the program: java Main
Enter the input text file name when prompted.
Enter the number of words to generate.
Enter the output file name.
The generated text will be written onto the specified output file.
